# STANDALONE-RGB-PC-FAN-MODULE
This project was created upon experiencing thermal throttling on my laptop and found usb cooling pads as not effective,
and those which were effective were highly priced.
So opted to use a good rgb PC fan instead, with a custom power supply for it so it can work as a standalone fan.

Please check the pin numbers and pins for their connections of your fan before proceeding

Please take safety precautions before working on live wires and also beware of the hot soldering iron.


ITEMS REQUIRED:
------------------------------------------------------------
RGB PC FAN -1

DC TO DC BOOST CONVERTER - 1

USB WIRE AND MOBILE CHARGER ADAPTER - 1

WIRES

MULTIMETER

SOLDERING IRON AND SOLDER

SPDT SWITCH - 1 (OPTIONAL)

MOLEX CONNECTOR FEMALE - 1 (OPTIONAL)

THEORY:
------------------------------------------------------------
RGB FAN HAS MAINLY 2 COMPONENTS, RGB AND THE FAN.

RGB REQUIRES A 5V DC INPUT WHILE THE FAN REQUIRES 12V DC INPUT

USUALLY RGB FANS COME WITH A MOLEX CONNECTOR WHICH HAS 4 PINS 

PIN MARKED 1 IS USUALLY A 12V AND PIN MARKED 4 IS A 5V .PIN 2 AND 3 ARE GROUND.

IN MY CASE ONLY PIN 2 WAS AVAILABLE AS COMMON GROUND SO I JOINED THE NEGATIVE WIRES OF 12V AND 5V TOGETHER AND CONNECTED TO PIN 2

PROCEDURE:
------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1:

TAKE AN OLD USB-A CABLE AND CUT THE NON USB-A PART 

REMOVE SHIELDING AND SEPARATE THE WIRES , KEEPING ONLY THE POWER WIRES WHICH ARE RED=POSITIVE AND BLACK= GROUND, CUT THE OTHER CABLES WHICH ARE DATA CABLES .

NOW STRIP THE RED AND BLACK WIRES, CONNECT THEM TO THE MULTIMETER AND CONNECT THE USB TO POWER AND CHECK IF U GET 5V , IF YES THEN PROCEED.

STEP 2:

TAKE 2 WIRES AND CONNECT THEM TO THE OUTPUT TERMINALS OF THE BOOST CONVERTER

CONNECT THE USB WIRES TO THE INPUT TERMINALS OF THE BOOST CONVERTER

CONNECT THE USB TO THE POWER


CONNECT THE MULTIMETER TO THE OUTPUT WIRES AND MEASURE THE OUTPUT VOLTAGE

USING THE SCREW ON THE POTENTIOMETER SET THE VOLTAGE TO 12V.

STEP 3:

TAKE 2 WIRES AND CONNECT THEM TO THE INPUT 5V TERMINALS OF BOOST CONVERTER .

SOLDER ALL THE WIRES ON THE BOOST CONVERTER.

(OPTIONAL) CUT THE POSITIVE 5V WIRE IN TWO PEICES CONNECT A SWITCH IN BETWEEN THEM .

YOU SHOULD BE LEFT WITH 4 LOOSE WIRES 2 COMING FROM INPUT OF BOOST CONVERTER (5V)AND 2 COMING FROM OUTPUT OF BOOST CONVERTER(12V)

STEP 4:

(OPTIONAL) TAKE A MOLEX FEMALE CONNECTOR AND ATTACH

 POSTIVE 12 V TO PIN 1 
 
POSITIVE 5V TO PIN 4

AND GROUNDS TO PIN 2 AND 3 OR JOIN THE THE TWO GROUND WIRES TOGETHER AND CONNECT TO EITHER 2 OR 3 PIN

OR 

JUST SOLDER THE WIRES TO THE MOLEX CONNECTER OF THE FAN

  POSTIVE 12 V TO PIN 1 
  
  POSITIVE 5V TO PIN 4
  
  AND GROUNDS TO PIN 2 AND 3 OR JOIN THE THE TWO GROUND WIRES TOGETHER AND CONNECT TO EITHER 2 OR 3 PIN

WE ARE ALL SET!!!

GIVE THE USB POWER AND VERIFY, ALSO TEST THE OPTIONAL SWITCH WHICH TURNS OFF ONLY THE RGB AND LETS ONLY THE FAN WORK.

END RESULT:
------------------------------------------------------------
NOW YOU HAVE A STANDALONE RGB PC FAN WHICH CAN BE POSITIONED HOWEVER YOU LIKE ACCORDING TO YOUR SETUP/LAPTOP, WHICH WORKS ON USB AND COOLS YOUR LAPTOP TREMENDOUSLY AND SAVES YOUR LAPTOP FROM THERMAL BOTTLENECK.

I HAVE NOTICED LESS FPS DROPS IN GAMES BY USING JUST ONE FAN.

THIS WHOLE PROJECT COST ME AROUND RS 600
------------------------------------------------------------
RGB FAN(ANT ESPORTS) - RS 500

BOOST CONVERTER - RS 100 

WIRES, USB CABLE- SALVAGED FROM OLD CABLES SO RS 0

ENOJOY AND GOOD LUCK!!!
